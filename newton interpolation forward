Algorithm:
1. Define variable
2. Read the no fo data n.
3. Read the data x and y as
for i=0 to n
   Read ax[i] and ay[i]
   end for i
4. Calcualte h=ax[1]-ax[0]
5. Calculate 1st order differences as
   for i=0 to n-1
       diff[i][1]=ay[i+1]-ay[i]
       end for i
 6. Calculte 2nnd and higher order differnce as
 for j=2 to higher order 
  for i=0 to n-j
     diff[i][j]=diff[i+1][j-1] - diff[i][j-1]
     end for i
     end for j
 7. Calculate p=(x-ax[i]/h)
              yp=ay[i]
 8. calculate interpolation valuse as
          for k=1 to orders 
          nu*=p-k-1
          de*=k
          yp+=(nu/de)*diff[i][k]
     print yp as interpolated value.
